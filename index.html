      <h3><p>Chicken Soup Ingredients</p></h3>
      <p>These are the simple ingredients you'll need for this chicken soup recipe:</p>
      <p>· Chicken: This homemade chicken soup starts with a 3-pound whole chicken.</p>

      <h3>How to Make Chicken Soup</h3>
      <P>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this easy chicken soup:</P>
      <p>1. Make the stock by boiling the chicken and veggies until the meat is falling off the bone.</p>
      <p>2. Remove the chicken and cut into pieces (discard skin and bones).</p>
      <p>3. Strain the vegetables (reserving the stock) and cut into pieces. Rinse the pot.</p>
      <p>4. Return everything to the pot. Heat the soup through and season to taste.</p> <br>
      <h3>How to Store Chicken Soup</h3>
      <p>Allow the chicken soup to cool, then transfer it to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for three to four days. Reheat thoroughly in the microwave or on the stove.</p> <br>
      <h3>Can You Freeze Chicken Soup?</h3>
      <p>Yes! You can freeze chicken soup for up to six months. Pour serving-sized portions of the cooled soup into freezer bags labeled with the date. Leave a little room at the top to allow for expansion,<br> then squeeze out the excess air and freeze flat. Reheat on the stove.</p>
